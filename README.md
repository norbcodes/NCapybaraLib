<h1>NCapybaraLib</h1>
<p>A small library with a bunch of functions and thingies I made for fun.<br>So far, there's nothing much, but it will grow as time goes.</p>
<p>Check out the library on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/NCapybaraLib/">PyPi</a>!</p>

<h1>Download</h1>
<p>
To download this library, run this command:
<pre><code>pip install NCapybaraLib</code></pre>
This library does not need any dependencies.
</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>
NCapybaraLib is split into multiple files.<br>To import the 'String' submodule for example, do this:
<pre><code>import NCapybaraLib.String
</code></pre>
Or, you can import <b>everything</b> using this handy tool:
<pre><code>import NCapybaraLib.All as NCapybaraLib
</code></pre>
As the code above suggests, this imports every class and object from the library.<br>
I personally suggest you also name it just NCapybaraLib, so it looks a bit better.<br><br>
What you <b>shouldn't do</b> though, is:
<pre><code>from NCapybaraLib.All import *
</code></pre>
This will pollute your global scope with all of the NCapybaraLib functions/classes :)
